Thomas Holloway ([@nyxtom](http://github.com/nyxtom))
=============================
Senior Software Engineer / Web Application Developer / Puzzle Hacker.

To whom it may concern, below is a high-level overview of the skills and work history to which I have so far been involved. As a life-long learner, my skills have adapted to the changing ecosystem of software in an effort to explore more challenging problems to work on. I attribute much of my success to a combination of pragmatism and forethought for fault-tolerant and elegant experiences. Pareto's Law helps illuminate how I approach time management and prioritization for even the most appetizing and challenging problems. My expertise ranges across various domains from design and analysis to implementation and deployment as a full-stack web developer.
